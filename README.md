### How it work

Diagram of the operation of the Birosca framework:

##### Birosca:
- Debugger vmprotect process
- Find OEP (Based on vm type)
- Insert Keo Stub to load Lain
- Find Vmexit(aka context exchange) standard present on version bellow than 2.x
- Make raw dumps
- Fix PE and IAT and make a dump

##### Lain:
- Hooking Anti-debugger (Usermode, Kernel Mode, Antivm)
- Give process memory level access to Birosca without VmProtect detecting it.

Birosca (A Brazilian term that accurately describes the functioning of the project: A simple project that fulfills its purpose without offering anything more for it, nor presenting itself as an expert, and focuses on its own growth over time. The tool was not developed for anything other than studies.) Birosca is capable of obtaining the Entrypoint of all versions below 2.X of the commercial packer VMPROTECT, through routines nicknamed "vmexit(aka context exchange)". During the development of the tool, the packer was studied in different protected files and versions to find the pattern present in these routines of virtualized code exit. Signatures were created for both (which work in a generic way), and the "vmexit(aka context exchange)" routines are used for context switching, API loading, and jumps to addresses when they have already been processed by the virtualized code of vmprotect (which is unique). However, the "vmexit"(aka context exchange) routines are standardized. Here is an example of such a routine:

```
.vmp2:0006AFED			 _vmexit_        proc near
.vmp2:0006AFED                   var_2C          = byte ptr -2Ch
.vmp2:0006AFED                   arg_10          = dword ptr  14h
.vmp2:0006AFED                   arg_14          = dword ptr  18h
.vmp2:0006AFED
.vmp2:0006AFED FC                                  cld
.vmp2:0006AFEE FC                                  cld
.vmp2:0006AFEF 9C                                  pushf
.vmp2:0006AFF0 FF 74 24 18                         push    [esp+4+arg_10]
.vmp2:0006AFF4 9D                                  popf
.vmp2:0006AFF5 60                                  pusha
.vmp2:0006AFF6 68 62 0F AC 2D                      push    2DAC0F62h
.vmp2:0006AFFB 54                                  push    esp
.vmp2:0006AFFC 88 04 24                            mov     [esp+2Ch+var_2C], al
.vmp2:0006AFFF FF 74 24 44                         push    [esp+2Ch+arg_14]
.vmp2:0006B003 C2 48 00                            retn    48h ; 'H'       ; Vai saltar ao endereço de stack(Alguns hooks também fazem isso. com informações via stack)
.vmp2:0006B003                               _vmexit_        endp
```
Example of vmexit routine in action (For Usermode Anti-debug checks):


![#3](imgs/imgb.png)

![#4](imgs/imgc.png)

In the examples of the screenshots above, vmprotect uses the routine to check for user-mode debuggers. However, it is also capable of checking for kernel-mode debuggers. It also utilizes syscalls for these checks, and after that, it will initiate the process of initializing the original PE.

In total, versions below 2.x perform the following calls for verification:

| Module   | API                        |
|----------|----------------------------|
| kernel32 | IsDebuggerPresent          |
| kernel32 | CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent |
| Kernel32 | GetThreadContext           |
| ntdll    | ZwQueryInformationProcess  |
| ntdll    | ZwSetInformationThread     |
| kernel32 | CreateFileA                |

[ ! ] CreateFileA is used to check for debuggers using:
- \\\\.\\SICE
- \\\\.\\SIWVID
- \\\\.\\NTICE
- \\\\.\\ICEEXT
- \\\\.\\SYSERBOOT

All these calls can be bypassed simply by inserting the Keo stub so that Birosca can load the "KELAIN" module into memory space and handle the calls to these APIs. This allows the Birosca VMP debugger to function smoothly.

END ENTRY POINT ROUTINE ASM RECOVERED FROM VMEXIT
if you are trying to unpack a VB 6.0 binary protected with VM Protect. remember that the entrypoint is not the entrypoint routine, but the entrypoint of the VB 6.0 opcode that Vmprotect has already resolved the symbol of the DLL(MSVBVM60.DLL) that interprets the opcodes and only makes the call, the stubs are the same, you can solve it manually only with the address I gave you.
```

Feel free to collaborate on improvements. this is developed for my study (This technique obviously won't work for newer versions as vmexit presents itself differently).
